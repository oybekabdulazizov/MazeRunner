# MazeRunner

Hello, 

This is a simple app created using html, css, js, and matter.js. 

The rules of the game: 
You need to control the ball (using W,D,S,A keys or arrow keys) and reach to the green rectangle in order to win. 
You can also get code to your machine, change the horizontal and vertical cells as you wish.

Good luck!
